Plugin for `cargo` to run commands against selected combinations of features.

### Installation

```bash
brew install romnn/tap/cargo-fc

# or install from source
cargo install cargo-feature-combinations
```

### Usage

In most cases, just use the command as if it was `cargo`:

```bash
cargo fc check
cargo fc test
cargo fc build
```

In addition, there are a few optional flags and the `matrix` subcommand.
To get an idea, consider these examples:

```bash
# run tests and fail on the first failing combination of features
cargo fc --fail-fast test

# silence output and only show final summary
cargo fc --silent build

# print all combinations of features in JSON (useful for usage in github actions)
cargo fc matrix --pretty
```

For details, please refer to `--help`:

```bash
$ cargo fc --help

USAGE:
    cargo [+toolchain] [SUBCOMMAND] [SUBCOMMAND_OPTIONS]
    cargo [+toolchain] [OPTIONS] [CARGO_OPTIONS] [CARGO_SUBCOMMAND]

SUBCOMMAND:
    matrix                  Print JSON feature combination matrix to stdout
        --pretty            Print pretty JSON

OPTIONS:
    --help                  Print help information
    --silent                Hide cargo output and only show summary
    --fail-fast             Fail fast on the first bad feature combination
    --exclude-package       Exclude a package from feature combinations 
    --only-packages-with-lib-target
                            Only consider packages with a library target
    --errors-only           Allow all warnings, show errors only (-Awarnings)
    --pedantic              Treat warnings like errors in summary and
                            when using --fail-fast
```

### Configuration

In your `Cargo.toml`, you can configure the feature combination matrix:

```toml
[package.metadata.cargo-feature-combinations]
# When at least one isolated feature set is configured, stop taking all project 
# features as a whole, and instead take them in these isolated sets. Build a 
# sub-matrix for each isolated set, then merge sub-matrices into the overall 
# feature matrix. If any two isolated sets produce an identical feature 
# combination, such combination will be included in the overall matrix only once.
#
# This feature is intended for projects with large number of features, sub-sets 
# of which are completely independent, and thus donâ€™t need cross-play.
#
# Non-existent features are ignored. Other configuration options are still 
# respected.
isolated_feature_sets = [
    ["foo-a", "foo-b", "foo-c"],
    ["bar-a", "bar-b"],
    ["other-a", "other-b", "other-c"],
]

# Exclude groupings of features that are incompatible or do not make sense
exclude_feature_sets = [ ["foo", "bar"], ] # formerly "skip_feature_sets"

# Exclude features from the feature combination matrix
exclude_features = ["default", "full"] # formerly "denylist"

# When using a cargo workspace, you can exclude packages in the *root* `Cargo.toml`
exclude_packages = ["package-a", "package-b"]

# In the end, always add these exact combinations to the overall feature matrix, 
# unless one is already present there.
#
# Non-existent features are ignored. Other configuration options are ignored.
include_feature_sets = [
    ["foo-a", "bar-a", "other-a"],
] # formerly "exact_combinations"
```

### Usage with github-actions

The github-actions [matrix](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs) feature allows more efficient testing of all feature set combinations in CI.

The following workflow file uses `cargo-feature-combinations` to automatically generate a feature matrix and runs up to 256 feature combinations in a matrix job.

First, add a workflow `feature-matrix.yaml` that computes the feature matrix for your project.
We will re-use this workflow in our `build.yaml` workflow.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/feature-matrix.yaml
name: feature-matrix
on:
  workflow_call:
    outputs:
      matrix:
        description: "feature matrix"
        value: ${{ jobs.matrix.outputs.matrix }}
jobs:
  matrix:
    name: Generate feature matrix
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    outputs:
      matrix: ${{ steps.compute-matrix.outputs.matrix }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: romnn/cargo-feature-combinations@main
      - name: Compute feature matrix
        id: compute-matrix
        run: |-
          MATRIX="$(cargo fc matrix)"
          echo "${MATRIX}"
          echo "matrix=${MATRIX}" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

Now, we can use the `feature-matrix.yaml` workflow to dynamically create jobs that build each combination of features with considerable speedup.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yaml
name: build
on:
  push: {}
  pull_request: {}
jobs:
  feature-matrix:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/feature-matrix.yaml

  build:
    name: build ${{ matrix.package.name }} (${{ matrix.os }}, features ${{ matrix.package.features }})
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    needs: [feature-matrix]
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        os: [macos-latest, ubuntu-24.04]
        package: ${{ fromJson(needs.feature-matrix.outputs.matrix) }}

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - name: Build
        # prettier-ignore
        run: >-
          cargo build
          --package "${{ matrix.package.name }}"
          --features "${{ matrix.package.features }}"
          --all-targets
```

Of course you can also apply the same approach for your `test.yaml` or `lint.yaml` workflows!

#### Local development

For local development and testing, you can point `cargo fc` to another project using
the `--manifest-path` flag.

```bash
cargo run -- cargo check --manifest-path ../path/to/Cargo.toml
cargo run -- cargo matrix --manifest-path ../path/to/Cargo.toml --pretty
```

#### Acknowledgements

The [`cargo-all-features`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-all-features) crate is similar yet offers more complex configuration and is lacking a summary.
